- **Responsive Design:** Facilitates the creation of responsive and mobile-friendly layouts.
- **Customization:** Customize themes and styles using Tailwind's configuration.

### SCSS (Sassy CSS)
- **Modular Styling:** Use SCSS to create modular styles that are easy to maintain and extend.
- **Variables:** Define variables for colors, fonts, and other parameters to ensure consistent styling throughout the app.
- **Mixins and Nesting:** Utilize SCSS mixins and nesting features to organize styles and reduce repetitive code.

### TypeScript
- **Static Typing:** Enhance code quality and reduce bugs with type checking.
- **Code Maintainability:** Improve code readability and maintainability with type annotations.
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with React, Redux, and other libraries.

### React
- **Component-based Architecture:** Build reusable UI components for efficient interface management.
- **State Management:** Manage application state using hooks and context.
- **React Router:** Implements navigation between different sections of the app without page reloads.
- **React Persist:** Provides state persistence across sessions by saving data in the browser's local storage.

### Redux Toolkit
